\section{Root-finding}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To find how many solutions each equation has in the given domain I 
	will rearrange all the equations to be equal to zero and then looks for 
	the zeros of the rearranged equations. As a corollary to the intermediate 
	value theorem, if a function is continuous and changes sign in a bracket 
	then that bracket must contain a zero. So I will plot each of the 
	rearranged equation and I look for appropriate brackets. I will use the 
	\verb*|pltFunc| function to plot the functions as it removes values 
	outside a defined limit which prevents MATLAB plotting discontinuous 
	functions as continuous. The limits can then be changed using the 
	property explorer to give a more useful plot.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Rearranging $x^{4} = e^{-x} \cos(x)$ gives $f(x) = x^{4} - 
		e^{-x} \cos(x)$.

			The second zoomed in plot shows there are two zeros in the given 
			domain. The first zero can be bracketed by $[-1.5,-1]$ as 
			$f(-1.5)=4.7455$ and $f(-1)=-0.4687$ so since the function is 
			continuous and there is a change of sign this bracket must 
			contain 
			a zero. Like wise the second root can be bracketed by $[0.5,1]$ 
			as $f(0.5)=-0.4698$ and $f(1)=0.8012$.
		\item Setting $f(x) = \frac{x^{3}}{\sin(x)} - 1$.

		The first root can be bracketed by $[-1,-0.5]$ as $f(-1) = 0.1884$ 
		and 
		$f(-0.5)=-0.7393$ and $f(x)$ is continuous in this bracket. Likewise, 
		the second root can be bracketed by $[0.5,1]$ as $f(0.5)=-0.7393$ and 
		$f(1)=0.1884$.
		\item Rearranging $\cot(x)$
