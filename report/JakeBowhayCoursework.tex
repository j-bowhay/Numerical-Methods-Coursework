\section{Root-finding}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To find how many solutions each equation has in the given domain I 
	will rearrange all the equations to be equal to zero and then looks for 
	the zeros of the rearranged equations. As a corollary to the intermediate 
	value theorem, if a function is continuous and changes sign in a bracket 
	then that bracket must contain a zero. So I will plot each of the 
	rearranged equation and I look for appropriate brackets. I will use the 
	\verb*|pltFunc| function to plot the functions as it removes values 
	outside a defined limit which prevents MATLAB plotting discontinuous 
	functions as continuous.
